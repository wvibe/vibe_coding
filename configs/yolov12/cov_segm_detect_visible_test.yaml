# Dataset configuration for YOLOv12 DETECTION on COV_SEGM (visible, test fraction)
# This file defines the dataset paths and class names for BBOX detection.
# The actual fraction of data used is controlled by the 'fraction' parameter
# in the main training configuration YAML.

# Dataset root directory (contains images/, labels/, etc.)
path: /home/ubuntu/vibe/hub/datasets/COV_SEGM/visible/bbox

# Image directories relative to 'path'
train: images/train
val: images/val
test: images/test # test set is a super set of val

# Number of classes
nc: 20

# Classes (Standard VOC 20 classes)
# Ensure this matches the class indices used during label generation
