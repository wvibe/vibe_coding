# Technology Stack

- Operate only within project folder, ask permission if you need to touch anything outside the project
- Use Conda environment 'vbl' for this project, use pip to install python packages
- Python for the backend, prefer version 3.12 for this project
- Pytorch for Machine Learning, prefer Huggingface libraries if applicable
- Use /Users/wmu/vibe/data for the root of ML data storage, create subfolders for different datasets.
- Use pytest for unittesting, and ruff for linting and formatting
- HTML/JS/Gradio for the frontend
- SQL databases, never JSON file storage
- Separate databases for dev, test, and prod
- When missing packages, check if the conda env vbl is activated correctly first
- When failed to connect or download from external website, check if proxy is set correctly first
