# Coding Preferences

– Always prefer simple solutions, Focus on the areas of code relevant to the task. DONOT implement extra functionality unless asked 
– Avoid duplication of code whenever possible, which means checking for other areas of the codebase that might already have similar code and functionality
– When fixing an issue or bug, do not introduce a new pattern or technology without first exhausting all options for the existing implementation. And if you finally do this, make sure to remove the old implementation afterwards so we don't have duplicate logic
– Keep the codebase very clean and well organized
– Avoid writing scripts in files if possible
– Avoid having files over 500 lines of code. Refactor at that point
– Mocking data is only needed for tests, never mock data for dev or prod
– Never overwrite my .env file without first asking and confirming
- when you are on a remote session when you see prompt like "dev-gpu-5512%" or "zsh: command not found:" always run 'bash' to activate my shell, and run "act vbl" to active conda env
