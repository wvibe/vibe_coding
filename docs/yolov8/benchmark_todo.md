# Benchmarking Implementation Status & Next Steps

## Current Status

The YOLOv8 benchmarking tool is mostly implemented with the following components:

1.  **Core Framework**:
    *   Configuration handling via `config.py` with Pydantic models
    *   Dataset loading/subset selection in `utils.py`
    *   Metric calculation in `metrics.py`
    *   Basic HTML report generation in `reporting.py`
    *   Main execution logic in `run_benchmark.py`

2.  **Implemented Features**:
    *   Multi-model comparison (run multiple models against same dataset)
    *   Core metrics calculation (mAP@0.5, mAP@0.5:0.95, area-based mAPs)
    *   Performance measurement (inference time, peak GPU memory)
    *   Basic bar chart visualizations for main metrics
    *   HTML report with aggregated results table

## Technical Issue

We encountered a persistent issue where the editing tool cannot modify files in the codebase. This prevented us from implementing the requested visualization enhancements:

*   mAP vs. IoU Threshold plot
*   Confusion matrix visualizations

## Required Changes

1.  **In `metrics.py`**:
    *   Add `import numpy as np`
    *   Modify `calculate_detection_metrics` to extract and return:
        *   Per-IoU threshold mAP values (from `det_metrics.ap.mean(0)`)
        *   The actual IoU thresholds list
        *   Confusion matrix data (from `det_metrics.confusion_matrix.matrix`)

2.  **In `reporting.py`**:
    *   Add `save_map_iou_plot` function to create line charts showing mAP vs. IoU
    *   Implement `save_confusion_matrix_plot` to generate heatmaps
    *   Update the HTML template to include sections for these visualizations
    *   Update `generate_html_report` to call these plotting functions

## Next Steps

1.  Apply the changes to `metrics.py` to extract and return the detailed data
2.  Implement the plotting functions in `reporting.py`
3.  Update the HTML report generation
4.  Test the benchmark with multiple models

With these changes, you'll get the requested mAP vs. IoU line plot showing how each model performs across different IoU thresholds, and confusion matrix visualizations for each model.
