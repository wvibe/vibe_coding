# Migration Guide: from `src.*` to `vibelab.*`

This document explains **how to migrate** all importable code that currently lives directly under `src/` (imported via `from src.â€¦`) into the new, namespaced package **`vibelab`**.

> **Goal:** after migration every runtime import will be `from vibelab.â€¦`, and no topâ€‘level module named `src` will be required in production or in tests.

## 1. Why change?

| Issue with `src.*` | Benefit of `vibelab.*` |
|--------------------|------------------------|
| `src` is a generic name â†’ risk of collision with other projects when installed together. | Unique namespace â†’ safe to publish wheels / upload to internal PyPI. |
| Running tests from repo root silently works (because `.` is on `PYTHONPATH`) but breaks in any other working dir. | Editable install ensures `vibelab` is always on `sys.path`, making code runnable from anywhere. |
| Harder for IDEs & type checkers to resolve imports. | IDEs can resolve `vibelab` instantly; mypy/pyright configs are simpler. |
| Packaging tools strip the `src` prefix, so `import src.â€¦` **fails** after building a wheel. | What you import locally is exactly what users/importers will import. |

## 2. Incremental Migration Strategy

We will **not** perform a bigâ€‘bang rename. Instead we move modules gradually while keeping the codebase green at every commit.

### 2.1 Oneâ€‘time preparation (already done)

```bash
mkdir -p src/vibelab
touch src/vibelab/__init__.py
```

The empty `__init__.py` makes `vibelab` a valid package immediately.

### 2.2 Module Migration Checklist

| Module | Status | PR | Notes |
|--------|--------|----|----|
| âœ… `utils.common` | Completed | - | Migrated to `vibelab.utils.common` |
| âœ… `utils.logging` | Completed | - | Migrated to `vibelab.utils.logging` |
| `utils.data_converter` | Pending | - | |
| `utils.data_loaders` | Pending | - | |
| `utils.metrics` | Pending | - | |
| `utils.visualization` | Pending | - | |
| `dataops.common` | Pending | - | |
| `dataops.cov_segm` | Pending | - | |
| `models.ext.yolo_ul` | Pending | - | |
| `models.ext.yolov11` | Pending | - | |
| `models.ext.yolov8` | Pending | - | |
| `models.py.transformer` | Pending | - | |
| `models.py.yolov3` | Pending | - | |
| `vibelab.utils` | Pending | - | Some direct modules in `vibelab` |

### 2.3 Conventional commit sequence

| Commit | Contents |
|--------|----------|
| **A**  | *Submodule refactor* â€“ merged to main already. |
| **B**  | Add `src/vibelab/` package, leave code untouched. CI should stay green because legacy imports still work. |
| **Câ€¦N**| For each logical unit (e.g. `utils.geometry`, `models.yolo`):<br>1. **Move file/dir** to `src/vibelab/â€¦`.<br>2. Fix all imports in code, tests, scripts.<br>3. Run `pytest` and `ruff` locally.<br>4. Push PR â€“ small, reviewable, easy to revert. |
| **Z**  | Delete `src/__init__.py` and any remaining loose modules; run `grep -R "from src\."` to ensure zero matches. |

### 2.4 Finding remaining legacy imports

```bash
grep -R "from src\." src tests scripts | cut -c1-120
```
(or use ripgrep `rg` for speed.)

CI pipeline will fail if this list is nonâ€‘empty once we reach commit **Z** (add a checkâ€‘step script).

## 3. Practical tips

### 3.1 IDE assisted rename

* **VS Code**: F2 rename symbol â†’ choose "Move to new file" if offered.
* **PyCharm**: Refactor â†’ Moveâ€¦ keeps imports in sync across project.

### 3.2 Keep imports sorted

Run `ruff format` (or `black + isort`) after each move to avoid noisy diffs.

### 3.3 Editable install stays valid

Because we keep `-e .` in `requirements.txt`, moved code is immediately importable without reinstalling anything.

### 3.4 Testing during transition

Run:

```bash
pytest -q
python -m vibelab.quickcheck   # any quick smoke scripts
```

after each batch move.

---
## 4. Updating external references

* **Scripts inside repo** â€“ update their shebang or import lines to `vibelab.â€¦` once the target module has been moved.
* **Notebooks** â€“ use *Find & Replace* or run unit tests embedded in notebooks.
* **Downâ€‘stream repos** (if any) â€“ coordinate a branch where they bump the dependency and update imports.

## 5. Done checklist

- [ ] No `grep -R "from src\."` matches (except this doc).
- [ ] All modules in the migration checklist completed.
- [ ] Old modules in src have been removed (`src/utils/common`, `src/utils/logging`, etc.).
- [ ] `pytest` passes in clean virtual env created from `requirements.txt`.
- [ ] `pip wheel .` builds a wheel; installing that wheel into a fresh env runs CLI entry-points successfully.
- [ ] Old tags / tutorials updated or marked deprecated.

### 5.1 Final cleanup tasks

After all modules have been migrated and all tests pass with the new imports:

1. Remove the old module directories from `src/`:
   ```bash
   rm -rf src/utils/common
   rm -rf src/utils/logging
   # ... and so on for all migrated modules
   ```

2. Update any remaining documentation or references.

3. Commit the final cleanup as the last migration step.

When all checkboxes are ticked, announce in `CHANGELOG.md`:

> **[BREAKING]** All imports are now under `vibelab.*`; `src.*` is no longer supported.
