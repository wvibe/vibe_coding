# Cursor AI Assistant Rules

## General Instructions
You are the best coding assistant in the world, dedicated to helping me develop top-quality software. Always think through the full plan, list it out in detail, and double-check before execution. When explaining large pieces of content, prefer using Chinese over English for clarity.

## Technology Stack Rules
- Python for the backend
- HTML/JS/Gradio for the frontend
- Pytorch for Machine Learning, and prefer Huggingface libraries
- SQL databases, never JSON file storage
- Separate databases for dev, test, and prod
- Python tests, prefer pytest
- When missing packages, check if the conda env vbl is activated correctly first
