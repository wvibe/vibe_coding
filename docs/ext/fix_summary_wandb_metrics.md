# WandB Metrics Warning Fix Summary

## Problem
The warning "WARNING ⚠️ W&B Callback: DetMetrics metrics object missing attributes." was appearing during training because the per-class metrics were not being properly logged.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. The `_log_per_class_metrics` function in `wb.py` was trying to access attributes from the `DetMetrics` object that might not be populated yet during early epochs.
2. The `DetMetrics` class uses a `Metric` object internally (`self.box`) which stores per-class metrics like `p`, `r`, `all_ap`, `maps`, and `ap_class_index`.
3. These attributes are only populated after the metrics have been processed with actual detection results.
4. During early epochs or when no detections are made, these arrays can be empty.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Attribute Checking
- Added checks to verify that metric arrays are not only present but also contain data
- Changed from just checking `hasattr()` to also checking `len() > 0`
- This prevents trying to access empty arrays

### 2. Improved Error Handling
- Changed logging level from `WARNING` to `DEBUG` for expected cases where metrics aren't populated yet
- This reduces noise in the logs while still providing debugging information if needed
- More descriptive messages to distinguish between different failure cases

### 3. Fixed DetMetrics Support
- The original code wasn't properly accessing the `box` attribute of `DetMetrics`
- Fixed to properly check `metrics.box` for DetMetrics instead of the metrics object directly
- This ensures we're accessing the correct attributes where the data is actually stored

## Code Changes in `wb.py`

```python
# Key changes:
1. Added length checks: `and len(metrics.box.ap_class_index) > 0`
2. Fixed DetMetrics handling to use `metrics.box` properly
3. Changed LOGGER.warning to LOGGER.debug for non-error cases
4. More specific debug messages for different scenarios
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix
1. No more WARNING messages during training
2. Per-class metrics will be logged to WandB when available
3. Debug messages (if enabled) will indicate when metrics aren't ready yet
4. Once the model starts making predictions, per-class metrics should appear in WandB

## Full Dataset Configuration
Created `configs/yolov12/finetune_yolo12_detect_cov_segm_full.yaml` with:
- `fraction: 1.0` to use full dataset
- `batch: 256` (32 per GPU) based on memory headroom from test run
- `workers: 80` (10 per GPU) for better data loading
- `warmup_epochs: 5` and `patience: 50` for longer training
- `save_period: 10` for less frequent checkpointing
- Project name: `runs/detect/yolo12_cov_segm_full`
